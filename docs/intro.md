# Intro

SDDP is your one stop shop for the highest quality Steam Deck information on the
net. The information here has been [highly vetted](sddp/sddp_advantage.md) for
accuracy and best practices. All in an Open Source, searchable, and easy to
navigate archive.

The goal and purpose of sddp.io is to inspire a new generation of loyal fans,
tweakers, and modders of the Steam Deck and Linux at large.

If you want to learn more about sddp.io itself, scroll down to the "boring"
section, otherwise jump right in to whatever section you find relevant.
