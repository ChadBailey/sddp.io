## Case material

Many reviewers have struggled to convey the material the Steam Deck is made
from. I think the material is most analogous to the material used in premium
controllers - i.e. the
[Black Matte Xbox Series X controller](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller)
or
[Nintendo Switch Pro controller](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/pro-controller/).

The entire Steam Deck is made from this material giving it a robust feel that
some have equated to "cheap" or "non-premium". I will allow the reader to come
up with their own conclusion of how a controller feels or should feel - that's
how a Steam Deck feels.
