_Q: I'm not sure if I want a Steam Deck, where should I find reliable unbiased
information on it so I can inform my decision?_

A: It's difficult to answer this one, as every review likely has some level of
bias. That said, my recommendation is to look at several and pick out the
features that matter to you.

One strategy you can try is if you happen to have a friend with a Steam Deck,
ask if they will let you try it out.

If you don't have that, consider watching some of the longer-timeline reviews of
people who have had it for a while. I think these can offer a deeper insight as
most people can't accurately assess a product within the first days of receiving
it.

Here are some longer-time horizon reviews to consider watching:

> I have no affiliation with any of this videos, was just a random sample of the
> YouTube search result "Steam Deck 6 months later". I did watch them before
> including to ensure they didn't contain any objectively incorrect information,
> but I didn't find any reviews with incorrect information so I included all of
> them.

The most objective advice one can give is to look at the reviews at aggregate.
Based on today's reviews it would appear that the Steam Deck has unquestionably
proven itself as a worthwhile product being reviewed positively across a large
gamut of user types. I will leave this decision to the reader to decide for
themselves. If you have any concerns about this or think you can add to the
discussion, please do

Though not my usual recommendation, I would probably suggest erroring on the
side of actually trying it. This is because the unique properties of the Steam
Deck make it very difficult to express over reviews - something I say as both a
personal anecdote and having noticed the pattern among reviewers before having
it myself.

Many reviewers and owners have reported they wouldn't have known how much they
would like the Steam Deck until they actually began using it. There is a 14 day
return window (see next section) and it would not be difficult to sell if you
did find for some reason you did not like it making it a low-risk proposition.
