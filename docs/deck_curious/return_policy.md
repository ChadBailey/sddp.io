summary.

The Steam Deck (and other hardware offerings by Valve) have a _14 day return
window_. Here is the important part snipped from the article (as of 8/29/22)

> [â€¦] you have the right to cancel any purchase of the Hardware on Steam within
> 14 days from the day on which you or a third party indicated by you (other
> than the carrier) receives the Hardware purchased.
