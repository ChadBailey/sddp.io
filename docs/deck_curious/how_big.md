The Steam Deck has become famous for its large size, but it's hard to put into
words. Here are some comparisons

## Comparisons

### Nintendo Switch

Even though the screen area nearly matches a Nintendo Switch, it's much larger
than a switch in person. Here are a few ways you can judge the size for yourself
from most reliable to least reliable.

1. If you plan to buy a case anyway, consider purchasing a case to use as a size
   proxy
2. 3d print your own "blank" deck using
   [the model](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3106923225208810470)
   Valve have provided
3. Check out the [specifications page](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech) where
   the size and weight dimensions are listed, try finding or creating something
   of similar size and weight
4. Use the "rough approximation" trick in the next section

## Rough size approximation trick for adults

1. Place your hands flat on your lap on both legs, below your collar bones (you
   may have to open your legs some to get the sizing right)
2. Your hands should be between your shoulders and neck
3. Without changing the position of your hands, curl your fingers inward as if
   you're holding something

This should give you an easy way to get a very unscientific estimate of the size
and how it may feel to hold in your hands.
