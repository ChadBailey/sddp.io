# Purchasing a Steam Deck

Due to demand, the Steam Deck is not yet available to purchase outright. You
have to first
[reserve your Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) for a $5
holding fee (applied towards the purchase of the deck).

Once you have made your reservation, you [will be notified](wheres_my_deck.md)
when your Steam Deck is available for purchase.

That said, there are many lessons we can learn from how Valve has handled other
hardware sales. That information can be used as clues to how Valve will sell the
Steam Deck once they catch up with current demand.

1. When Valve have been unable to secure components, they have labeled the Index
   as out of stock.
2. They only sell through the Steam store
3. When Valve have had components necessary for the Index, they have used a
   pre-order system much like the one Steam Deck uses, though with much shorter
   lead times
4. Anecdotally, I've never seen the Index have more than a month lead time while
   pre-orders were still open. This may indicate they prefer to keep low stocks,
   but anticipate demand well enough to not have a lead time over a month.
