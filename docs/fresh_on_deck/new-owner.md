_Q: I just got my Steam Deck, what should I do first?_

A: Set it up and play some games!

### Valuable tips

Here are some starter tips I would offer to any new Steam Deck user

#### Tinkering is optional (see Deck Verified section)

If you don't want to tinker, don't feel pressured. There's nothing wrong with
simply playing that are labeled as "Great on Deck" and never entering Desktop
Mode. The Steam Deck will offer a flawless and simple experience if this is your
style.

That said, I'll mirror the advice I've seen others say which is the Steam Deck
invites tinkering as is one of its greatest strengths. If you decide to mess
with it a bit, you will probably have a much better experience than that time
you tried to get homebrew on your Wii and messed it up.

#### Nearly every game technically works

### Deck Verified

1. Look for games rated "Deck Verified" or "Great on Deck" for a no-fuss
   experience
2. View your existing library using
   [this tool](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/mygames) to determine
   which games you already have may already be verified.
3. View the [Great on Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/greatondeck) Steam
   store page for games rated this way. Some are free
4.
