This is a list of things you should _consider doing_ when you first get your new
Steam Deck. The idea is to have all common things in this list, to prompt the
user to do what they want to do.

1. Perform all system updates
2. Redeem rewards (you will be notified - Steam Deck profile and background)
3. Set up deck preferences
   1. Time zone
   2. Notifications
   3. Friends list sign-on
   4. Security/Lock code
   5. Fan control
   6. Adaptive brightness
   7. Keyboard theme
4. Purchase desired accessories
5. Create a USB recovery image to keep with the Deck
6. Switch to desktop (Power > Switch to Desktop), Open Discover and install apps
   1. CoreKeyboard (Sometimes necessary when Steam's keyboard doesn't work)
   2. Browser (I recommend Brave if you haven't tried it)
   3. Discord
   4. Heroic Games Launcher
   5. Telegram
7. Establish shell password (open Konsole, type `passwd`)
8. Install [Lutris](https://lutris.net/downloads) if you want to install and
   play non-steam PC games
9. Install [EmuDeck](https://emudeck.com) if you want to play roms
