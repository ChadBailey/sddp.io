The Steam Deck Documentation Project (sddp.io) is a collaborative effort to
create the best possible documentation to the Steam Deck. The goal is to inspire
a new generation of loyal fans, tweakers, and modders of the Steam Deck and
Linux at large.

More specifically, sddp.io aims to be:

- Collaborative
- A "one stop shop" for all vital Steam Deck technical information
- As concise as practical
- Beginner friendly, but also expert friendly
- A path to mastery for those who choose to take it

> If you believe in the mission of sddp.io please consider becoming a
> collaborator. We need experts and newbies alike. If you find something to be
> confusing or valuable think something is missing
> [Open a bug](https://github.com/chadbailey/sddp.io/issues). My guarantee to
> you is that you will never be rejected or made fun of for your honest
> feedback.
