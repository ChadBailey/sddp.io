[Quick Start](quickstart.md)

The Steam Deck Documentation Project (sddp.io) is a collaborative effort to
create the best possible documentation to the Steam Deck. The goal is to inspire
a new generation of loyal fans, tweakers, and modders of the Steam Deck and
Linux at large.

More specifically, sddp.io aims to be:

- Collaborative
- A "one stop shop" for all vital Steam Deck technical information
- As concise as practical
- Beginner friendly, but also expert friendly
- A path to mastery for those who choose to take it

> If you believe in the mission of sddp.io please consider becoming a
> collaborator. We need experts and newbies alike. If you find something to be
> confusing or think something is missing then
> [open an issue](https://github.com/chadbailey/sddp.io/issues).
>
> My guarantee to you is that you will never be rejected or made fun of for your
> honest feedback. Anyone who engages in such behavior will be handled promptly.

## Motivation

I have a much longer explanation I could share, but I'll keep this (somewhat)
brief. Perhaps someday I will share my full storyâ€¦

Suffice to say that I am a self-taught software engineer and owe much of my
career to anonymous contributors to efforts similar to sddp.io (sddp's namesake,
[The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org) chief among them).

I did not notice it at the time, but later in life I realized merely reading the
words written by these incredibly intelligent and caring individuals was acting
as a way to mentor me into my future career. I couldn't thank them enough
metaphorically, but logistically I also literally can't thank them. Many I don't
even remember learning from, and others I only knew by IRC screen names and lost
contact with long ago. No doubt plenty are of retirement age, if they weren't
already when we met.

I seek to establish sddp.io in order to pass down the legacy of these unsung
heros and "pay it forward" by inspiring the next generation of individuals
passionate about software, gaming, and tinkering. I don't know if sddp.io will
serve this purpose to anyone, but it's worth the effort if there's a chance it
holds true for even one person. Whoever you are reading this, I wish you nothing
but success.

I suppose I should address the elephant in the room, why the Steam Deck? I
recognize a historical movement when I see one. I've been using Linux since I
was 13, and one of the very first things I discovered is how my Windows software
was never going to work on it. I was pretty fine with this arrangement, had it
not been for being so invested in PC gaming. Countless times have come and gone
where people have said "This is the year of the Linux Desktop!" but it was all
empty promises. I _knew_ it wasn't ready yet. When I got the Steam Deck,
however, for the first time in 24 years I was the one saying it.

Valve has gifted the world with something no amount of money could buy, the
opportunity for young people's minds everywhere to be expanded by the
capabilities of this handheld device. I personally believe the amount of young
peoples' minds and futures who will be significantly impacted by the Steam Deck
will be rivaled only by the likes of Minecraft. I really want to be here to
support and encourage them, equipping them with all the information and tools
they need to feed their curiosity.

That is why I chose the Steam Deck for the only project of this kind I've ever
decided to attempt.

## Mission Statement

> Ensure the Steam Deck's success as a platform in order to grow new loyal fans
