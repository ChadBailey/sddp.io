# SDDP Donations

SDDP is not accepting donations at this time, nor has any plans to in the
future. The truth is, this project is done purely for the joy of it and that
must remain the case for it to work at all. The moment this is no longer a labor
of love no amount of donations could get me to continue.

In the most unexpected scenario where SDDP grows so much it becomes its own NPO,
then donations may begin to make sense. Meanwhile, enjoy my free gift to you.

If you still insist, you may make your donation to any worthwhile charity in
honor of sddp.io, that would bring me joy.
