updates and corrections until this banner is removed. :construction:

Create a repository of highly vetted documentation empowering users to extend
the usefulness of the Steam Deck by creating Steam Deck specific applications,
utilities, workflows, modifications, and extensions. Make it easy for beginners
but offer an gentle path towards mastery for those who wish to take it.

This will result in a robust community capable of seeding a new generation of
loyal fans of Linux and the Open Source ethos.
