   > Be careful, there are lots of scam MicroSD cards that do not work! If it
   > looks too good to be true, it might be. Look for the U with the 3 in the
   > middle for the best performing MicroSD cards
2. Cheaper MicroSD cards from reputable vendors.

   [Micro Center](https://www.amazon.com/Center-Memory-Adapter-Mobile-Storage/dp/B0B8GLD17C/)
   > Slower U1 MicroSD cards can be found for cheaper than U3 MicroSD cards. U1
   > should still give acceptable performance. I would not recommend going below
   > U1 in speed for gaming, but it would probably work fine.
