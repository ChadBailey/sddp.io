## Pre-Purchase Research

### Reviews

_Q: I'm not sure if I want a Steam Deck, where should I find reliable unbiased
information on it so I can inform my decision?_

A: It's really difficult to answer this one, as every review likely has some
level of bias. That said, my recommendation is to look at several and pick out
the features that matter to you.

One strategy you can try is if you happen to have a friend with a Steam Deck,
ask if they will let you try it out.

If you don't have that, consider watching some of the longer-timeline reviews of
people who have had it for a while. I think these can offer a deeper insight as
most people can't accurately assess a product within the first days of receiving
it.

Here are some longer-time horizon reviews to consider watching:

> I have no affiliation with any of this videos, was just a random sample of the
> YouTube search result "Steam Deck 6 months later". I did watch them before
> including to ensure they didn't contain any objectively incorrect information,
> but I didn't find any reviews that fit that criteria.

I think the most objective advice I can give is to say Steam Deck has
unquestionably proven itself as a worthwhile product that the average review has
reviewed positively.

This is not my usual recommendation, but I recommend erroring on the side of
actually trying it. This is because many users have reported they wouldn't have
known how much they would like the Steam Deck until they actually began using
it. Also it would not be difficult to sell if you did find for some reason you
did not like it making it a low-risk proposition.

### Reservation

_Q: I just submitted my reservation, what's next?_ A: Reservations are fulfilled
in the order they are received. That said, Valve has
[increased Steam Deck deliveries](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544)
exponentially and rumored to have all orders fulfilled within 2022.

_Q: I just got my Steam Deck, what should I do first?_

A: Set it up and play some games!

Here are some starter tips for any new Steam Deck user

1. If you don't want to tinker, don't feel pressured. There's nothing wrong with
   simply playing games that are labeled as "Great on Deck" and never entering
   Desktop Mode.
