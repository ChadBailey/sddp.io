This repository houses the documents for [sddp.io](https://sddp.io). For more
information about sddp.io, read the [about page](docs/about.md).

SDDP uses [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) for an easy and straight forward
user experience of editing the docs in Markdown.

Markdown lacks many features of more advanced structured typesetting languages
such as LaTeX and reStructuredText, but the tradeoff is that it's easy and
approachable for new people.
